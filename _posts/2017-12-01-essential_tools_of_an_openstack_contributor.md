This year again, I had the chance to attend the [OpenStack Day
France](https://openstackdayfrance.fr/) one day event in Paris and present
about the tools we use in the OpenStack community to contribute to the project.

My talk covered the different kinds of contribution and highlighted some of the
lesser known -- but essential -- tools available, giving tips and tricks learned
from years of practice. I hope both the casual contributor and the more
experienced one can find useful nuggets of information in this presentation.

This time, all the sessions were recorded and the videos should be available
shortly. Overall, I found this event was very well organized with a nice crowd
of around 400 attendants. Kudos to the [OpenStack-fr](http://openstack.fr/)
team for making this second edition a success. See you there next year!
